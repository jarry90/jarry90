### Hi there üëã
I am a python developer with a Bachelor of Engineering and extensive experience working as a civil engineer. I have recently committed to a career change into software engineering where I believe my strong skills in project management, mathematics, statistics and problem solving will be directly transferable. 

I completed programming courses at university and have always been interested in software development and coding as a hobby. I have often experimented with creating websites and have created many small python programs for personal use and to help automate work tasks. I have recently completed a Python development course and am interested in moving into a full time role as a developer. I am particularly interested in Python development but have a fundamental understanding of C and JAVA and am eager and willing to upskill where necessary.

I am passionate about writing code and am excited to continue learning while working.
