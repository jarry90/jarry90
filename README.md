I am a software developer with a Graduate Certificate in Information Technology (GPA 6.5/7) and a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil). I have 10+ years of experience working as a project manager / civil engineer and have recently committed to a career change into software engineering. I have always been interested in software development and coding as a hobby and I believe my strong skills in project management, mathematics, statistics and problem solving will be directly transferable.</p>

I am passionate about writing code and am interested in moving into a full time role as a developer.
