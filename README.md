### Hi there üëã

**`SOFTWARE DEVELOPER`**

I am a software developer with a Bachelor of Engineering and extensive experience working as a civil engineer. I have recently committed to a career change into software engineering where I believe my strong skills in project management, mathematics, statistics and problem solving will be directly transferable. 

I am currently working towards a Graduate Certificate in Information Technology and have always been interested in software development and coding as a hobby. I have often experimented with creating websites and have created many small python programs for personal use and to help automate work tasks. I have completed learnings in python, django and SQLServer; and am continuing to develop these areas and expand with MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js.

I am passionate about writing code and am interested in moving into a full time role as a developer.
