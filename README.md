### Hi there 👋
I am a python developer with a Bachelor of Engineering and extensive experience working as a civil engineer. I have recently committed to a career change into software engineering where I believe my strong skills in project management, mathematics, statistics and problem solving will be directly transferable. 

I completed programming courses at university and have always been interested in software development and coding as a hobby. I have often experimented with creating websites and have created many small python programs for personal use and to help automate work tasks. I have recently completed a Python development course and am interested in moving into a full time role as a developer. I am particularly interested in Python development but have a fundamental understanding of C and JAVA and am eager and willing to upskill where necessary.

I am passionate about writing code and am excited to continue learning while working. 

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
[Advanced Job Search](https://github.com/jarry90/Adv-job-search) - An app that that takes advanced search metrics and scrapes Seek, indeed and Linkedin jobs for suitable matched, then emails you a formatted list. The project is a work in progress and can currently take defined variables for search terms and location, then return a list from seek. Will work on adding user input for search terms and location, functionality for indeed and Linkedin, and email subscription.
